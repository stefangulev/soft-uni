I have not worked with a server different from MYSQL, so I was unable to adapt the file provided in the task, and therefore, I went to build the project without having data. 
My idea was to build the database using the code-first approach, so I can atleast have some tables to work with.
I ran out of time, so I was not able to finish the second task. Apologies!
